  // By default, questions offer up to 1000 points when a player responds correctly. You can toggle this to 0 or 2000 if you'd prefer.

  // How points work
  // Points are awarded based on speed of answer. This is how points are calculated:

  // Divide response time by the question timer. For example, a player responded 2 seconds after a 30-second question timer started. 2 divided by 30 is 0.0667.
  const timeByTimePerQuestion = answer.time / timePerQuestion;
  // Divide that value by 2. For example, 0.0667 divided by 2 is 0.0333.
  const dividedByTwo = timeByTimePerQuestion / 2;
  // Subtract that value from 1. For example, 1 minus 0.0333 is 0.9667.
  const subtractFromOne = 1 - dividedByTwo;
  // Multiply points possible by that value. For example, 1000 points possible multiplied by 0.9667 is 966.7.
  const byPossiblePoint = subtractFromOne * question.value;
  // Round to the nearest whole number. For example, 966.7 is 967 points.
  // For math wizards, this can be expressed as:

  // ⌊ ( 1 - (( {response time} / {question timer} ) / 2 )) {points possible} ⌉
  const rounded = Math.round(byPossiblePoint);
